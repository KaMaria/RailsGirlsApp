We've had lots of people asking us if this project is open for all to work on and if they can contribute even though they are

- a) not women,
- b) not in our project group,
- c) don't know us, 
- d) some other reason. 

The answer is of course yes! We are not a closed group and we welcome your Pull Requests (PR). All we ask is that you communicate with us regularly, make clean PRs (using the template we provide when you submit a PR), test your work, and be nice. 

If you write some ingenious code, explanations are helpful so that we can learn from what you've done and become better coders ourselves in the process. If you have a great idea for a feature & want to implement it, please open an issue, assign yourself to it, and hack away :)
